# Edge2Guard: On-device Botnet Attacks Detecting Methods for Tiny IoT Devices

Edge2Guard (E2G) enables MCU-based IoT devices to instantly detect IoT-attacks without depending on networks (standalone) or any external protection mechanisms (offline). Due to the resource-friendly design of our E2G models, they can execute on tiny devices, without imposing computational pressure and also without disturbing device routine. In the following, we describe each file in this directory:
